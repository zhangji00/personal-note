1.GetBooks()

This method belongs to a data source, and we don't care how it is obtaining them, we just want to Get them from the data source.

2.FetchBooks()

You treat your data source like a bloodhound, and it is his job to fetch your books. I guess you should decide on your own how many he can fit in his mouth at once.

3.FindBooks()

Your data source is a librarian and will use the Dewey Decimal system to find your books.

4.LoadBooks()

These books belong in some sort of "electronic book bag" and must be loaded into it. Be sure to call ZipClosed() after loading to prevent losing them.

5.RetrieveBooks()

Nothing
